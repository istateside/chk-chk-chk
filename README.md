# CHK CHK CHK
This is a command line tool to easily switch between git branches.
It's helpful in repos where you have many branches that you switch between frequently.

This is in very early development. I don't recommend using it if you want a stable tool, but you do you.

(This is a bad name taken from a band I've never listened to.)

## Installation

```
$ npm install -g chk-chk-chk
```

## Usage
```
$ chk
```

This will open up a fuzzy-finder search tool for your branches. Press up/down to navigate between
options, and press Enter to select a branch.
